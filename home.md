Information gathered via binary string extraction, WPR, IDA, Procmon, etc. Default values from WinDbg, IDA, and stock installations. Some options lack proof, as they're easily traceable. Minor mistakes or misinterpretations may exist, corrections are welcome.

The tool is based on the GitHub repository and parses its information out of it. The [`App Tools`](https://github.com/5Noxi/app-tools)/[`Game Tools`](https://github.com/5Noxi/game-tools) are external PowerShell scripts, same goes for the [`Component Manager`](https://github.com/5Noxi/comp-mgr), [`Blocklist Manager`](https://github.com/5Noxi/blocklist-mgr) & [`Bitmask Calculator`](https://github.com/5Noxi/bitmask-calc).
