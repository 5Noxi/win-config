# CPMinCores | Microsoft Learn

`CPMinCores` specifies the minimum percentage of logical processors (in terms of all logical processors that are enabled on the system within each NUMA node) that can be placed in the un-parked state at any given time.

For example, in a NUMA node with 16 logical processors, configuring the value of this setting to 25% ensures that at least 4 logical processors are always in the un-parked state. The Core Parking algorithm is disabled if the value of this setting is 100%.
