# HeteroDecreaseThreshold1 | Microsoft Learn

`HeteroDecreaseThreshold1` specifies the threshold to cross below, which is required to park the Nth class 2 core. There is a separate value for each core index. The threshold is relative to efficiency class 1 performance. The provisioning interface can specify up to 4 different thresholds. If the system has 5 or more class 2 cores, the 4th value is used for all remaining cores of the same class.

## Aliases and setting visibility

- **Windows provisioning:**`Common\Power\Policy\Definitions\Processor\HeteroDecreaseThreshold1`
- **Windows Provisioning:**`Common\Power\Policy\Settings\Processor\HeteroDecreaseThreshold1`
- **PowerCfg:**`HETERODECREASETHRESHOLD1`
- **Hidden setting:** Yes

## Values

`HeteroDecreaseThreshold1` is a four-byte unsigned integer where each byte represents a threshold in percentage. See [HeteroIncreaseThreshold](configuration-for-hetero-power-scheduling-heteroincreasethreshold.md) for configuring the thresholds.
