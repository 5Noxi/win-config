# Battery settings overview | Microsoft Learn

Settings in this subgroup control the customization of battery actions and thresholds.

Windows will execute the  [Critical Battery Action](battery-settings-critical-battery-action) | when the battery is in the critical battery power state. The critical battery power state is determined when the battery percentage reaches the higher of:

1. The [DefaultAlert1 Threshold](/en-us/windows/win32/power/battery-information-str), for systems which use the ACPI control method battery interface, is provided by default capacity of low
2. The battery charge level configured via provisioning or powercfg (the  [Critical Battery Threshold](battery-settings-critical-battery-threshold) |)

For example, if a device with one battery has the first value as 10% and the second value as 5%, the battery would enter the critical battery power state at 10%.

To view these two values, run **pwrtest.exe /info:battery** from a repro system.

In the case of a device with multiple batteries, the Critical Battery Action will execute if any of the batteries are in a critical battery power state.
